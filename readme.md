You will create a resume that exists entirely within the developer console.
Objectives

    Create a project folder linked to github, and inside that folder an index.html file and a javascript file. Link the JavaScript file to the index.html file.
    Your "resume" will simply be a series of console.log statements to print the resume data to the console.
    When you open index.html in the browser, it will be a blank page. That's okay. Your resume will be in the console. (command + option + I, or F12)
    Your resume should display the following information:
        Your name
        Your career/field
        A short description of yourself
        A list of your interests
        A list of your past positions that includes company/place name, title, short description of what you did
        A list of your skills
    You can make up information if you'd like
    In your skill list, skills that are "cool" should begin with BAM:

Additional Requirements

    Your name should print in all capital letters, but you must not type it as all capitalized in your code (i.e. you will need to use JavaScript to capitalize it)
    You must have a function called displayPosition that takes parameters for company name, job title, and description. The function should console.log those three items in a format similar to the entries in the "My Previous Experience" section of the example below. You will call displayPosition several times with different data to create each entry for the "My Previous Experience" section.
    You must have a function called displaySkill that takes parameters for skill name and a boolean value for whether the skill is cool (true/false). Inside the function, you should print BAM: in front of the skill name only if the skill is cool. If you don't have any cool skills, make some up. Use this function to display each entry in the "My Skills" section.
